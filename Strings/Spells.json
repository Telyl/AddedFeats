Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creatureÅfs size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged."
